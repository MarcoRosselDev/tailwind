    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ (180 ml.) cup of whole milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of butter, melted</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of granulated sugar</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>¾ cup (110 grams) of all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>16 tablespoons of filling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a blender or food processor, combine the milk, melted butter, eggs,
        sugar, and salt. Blend for a few seconds until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the flour and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate
        for at least 1 hour or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take the mixture out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes before making
        the pancakes and whisk with a balloon whisk to lighten it a little, 30
        seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a non-stick frying pan about 23-25 ​​cm in diameter over
        medium-high heat until a few drops of water sprinkled on it dance and
        jump before evaporating. Add 1/4 cup or 60 ml or half a ladle of batter
        to the pan, swirling the pan so the batter covers the entire bottom.
        Cook for 45-60 seconds, and when the edges begin to brown and lift
        slightly, use a spatula to flip the pancake and cook for another 45
        seconds. The first one won't turn out perfectly, but it's still edible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stack the cooked pancakes on a plate and keep them covered with a clean
        kitchen towel so they don't get cold.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, spread about 2 tablespoons of dulce de leche or your favorite
        jam on the pancake, and fold it into quarters or roll it up. Sprinkle
        with powdered sugar and serve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once cooked, the pancakes can be frozen well wrapped in kitchen plastic
        wrap then in aluminum foil for up to 2 months, thaw on the counter, fill
        and heat in the oven at 300F or 150C or in the microwave.
